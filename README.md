## About

DTI Slack Birthday Bot (nicknamed Halpert) sends birthday celebration messages
for team members when the special day comes!

This functionality already exists in some Slack apps. However, enterprise rates
for existing solutions are quite high, and DTI is pretty big. Halpert aims to be
a simple self-hosted alternative that doesn't cost as much.

## Features

Currently supports:

- Collecting birthday information (through a Slack modal)
- Sending birthday messages to a configurable channel
- Sending welcome message to new Slack users

Roadmap:

- Sending birthday reminders to others (ex: 1 week before)
- Supporting multiple teams and birthday message channels
